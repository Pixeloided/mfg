            <p>To start the lesson, please know at least the following:</p>
            <list>
                <li>Basic understanding of CNC machines &amp; their parts</li>

            <tip>
                <p>Any machine tool is potentially dangerous. A CNC machine's
                    automation presents added risk not present in a manual
                    machine.</p>
                <p>You can download the safety section of the manual here:</p>

            <procedure title="Layout of the machine">
                <step>Find the on/off toggle</step>
                <step>Find the emergency stop</step>
                <step>Find the compressed air hose</step>
                <step>Notice the lack of door switch</step>

                <step>What is the proper procedure if the machine crashes?</step>
                <step>What is the best way to protect yourself from sharp chips and excess coolant?</step>
                <step>Recognize proper attire: Tie up long hair, wear close-toed shoes, and no excessively baggy clothing.</step>
                <step>Recognize the importance of a clean work area.</step>
            </procedure>
            <procedure title="DO's">
                <step>Always keep the work area clean and free of clutter. Machine motion can occur if controls are accidentally activated.</step>
                <step>Always immediately clean up all spills after they occur.</step>
                <step>Be aware that the machine is automatically controlled and can start at any time.</step>
                <step>Become familiar with all physical and software controls</step>
                <step>Use a chip scraper or brush when clearing away chips, oil, or coolant.</step>
                <step>Always examine all tools, fixtures, workpieces, and guarding for signs of damage. Replace any damaged components as soon as you find them. The enclosure and other guards may not stop all types of projectiles, like broken tools or loose workpieces.</step>
                <step>Always stop the machine and verify that all machine motions have completely stopped before taking any manual action within the machine enclosure.</step>
                <step>When machining an unproven operation, always use the proper precautions, including feed, speed, and maximum velocity overrides, Distance-to-Go (DTG) displays, single block, feed hold, and other control features.</step>
                <step>Always follow all machine standards, and do not deviate from standard operating procedures.</step>
                <step>Always respect the machine and its capabilities</step>
            </procedure>
            <procedure title="DONT's">
                <step>Never operate the machine after consuming alcohol or taking medication that could prevent you from safely operating the machine.</step>
                <step>Never operate the machine while tired or otherwise impaired.</step>
                <step>Never enter the machining envelope.</step>
                <step>Never reach around a guard.</step>
                <step>Never let the machine run fully unattended (Lights-out operation is NOT permitted.)</step>
                <step>Never obstruct the Emergency Stop button or any other controls.</step>
                <step>Never let an untrained operator monitor, manage, or use the machine.</step>
                <step>Never modify, defeat, or bypass safety devices or interlocks.</step>
                <step>Never machine abrasive, carcinogenic, explosive, flammable, radioactive, or toxic materials.</step>
                <step>Never allow swarf (chips) to accumulate on or within the machine.</step>
                <step>Never use water, coolants without rust inhibitors, or straight cutting oil in the machineâ€™s coolant system.</step>
                <step>Never modify the machine's electronics</step>
                <step>Never conduct horseplay around or near the machine.</step>
