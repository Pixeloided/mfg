    <p>
        The Tormach 1100M is a great machine for getting started with true CNC Machining. It is versatile, easy to learn, and quite powerful to get started out on.
    </p>

    <p>
        In these series of lessons, you will learn the ropes of this machine. Starting with a simple domino, you will work your way up to more complex parts, learning everything from toolpath generation to fixturing techniques. Please pay attention carefully and follow all steps provided, as to not cause damage to the machine.
